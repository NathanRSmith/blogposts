This past weekend (April 11-13, 2014) I had to priviledge of attending [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2014/) in Montreal, Canada.  I only attended the conference portion, but there was also tutorials the week before and sprints the week after.  I got there Thursday evening just in time to catch the end of the opening reception and start collection conference swag.

The conference took place at the Montreal Convention Center (Palais des congrès de Montréal).  This place was huge our 2500 attendees (as reported on Friday) hardly seemed to make a dent in it.  Activities spanned the multiple levels of gigantic rooms divided up for various purposes included keynotes, 5 talk tracks, lighning talks, breakfast, lunch, vendor booths, job fair, poster sessions, open rooms, charity auction, 5k fun run and a lot more.

Most of the talks should be up on [PyVideo](http://www.pyvideo.org/category/50/pycon-us-2014) by now, so check them out if you're interested.

I jumped around from track to track, but here is a list of the talks I attended:

On the Sunday I unfortunately had to head to the airport before the talks started, so I couldn't catch any of them in person.  Looking over the list of talks I missed there are a lot of them I'll have to watch in the next few weeks.

I had a great time at PyCon and hope to be able to go again in the future.  [PyOhio](http://www.pyohio.org/) is coming up in a few months, so that will have to tide me over til next year.
